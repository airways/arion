# Arion Email / Arion CRM

Arion is intended to be a modern, advanced email client coupled with the features of a powerful, fully customizable and extensible CRM (and much more).

# Email Based CRM

Arion is at its best when you connect it to your email inbox. In this mode, Arion functions as the best email client you've ever used -- allowing you read your mail, respond to it, and write new messages all in a comfortable, easy to use and modern email interface.

Arion can do much more than let you manually handle your email -- it also provides features to automatically handle email that you designate by creating tasks and reminders, tickets, and even (if you want it to) automatically replying to messages where you configure it to do so.

# Much More

Arion is not just an email client and not just a CRM -- but at its core general, highly adaptive database system you can use to manage any kind of business workflow. It comes with a CRM out of the box but can do much more than traditional CRM solutions.

When implementing your own workflows, Arion provides the same powerful tools used to built its core functionality to you directly, so you can create new email based workflow, or an entirely new application, right inside of Arion.


## Requirements

Arion and Symfony requires PHP 5.6.0 or higher as well as the mbstring and PDO extensions. PHP 7.4 is preferred.

Arion requires MySQL 5.5.0 or higher.
